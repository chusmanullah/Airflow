## Learning Apache Airflow
- Apache Airflow is a tool to BUILD, SCHEDULE and Monitor data pipelines.
so what is data pipeline
its Set of data processing elements connected in series
The output of the one element is the input of the next one.

Similar to other workflow managers, Airflow allows you to define pipelines or workflows as DAGs of tasks. These graphs are very similar to the examples sketched in the previous section, with tasks being defined as nodes in the graph and dependencies as directed edges between the tasks.
